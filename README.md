## Getting started

You can experience the capabilities of Asgardeo Tomcat SAML Agent by following this small guide which contains main sections listed below.

  * [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
  * [Configuring the sample](#configuring-the-sample)
  * [Create an Application in Asgardeo](#create-an-application-in-asgardeo)
  * [Running the sample](#running-the-sample)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Configuring the sample
1. Open a terminal window inside a preferred directory on your machine.

2. Deploy the **sample** app.
   - a. Execute the following command to start the sample Docker container.
   
    ```
    docker container run --rm --name tomcat-saml-agent-sample -itdp 8080:8080 asgardeo/tomcat-saml-agent-sample
    ```
   - b. You can also manually deploy the **sample** app in a Tomcat server without using the docker image. Simply download `sample-app.war` from [here](https://github.com/asgardeo/asgardeo-tomcat-saml-agent/releases/latest) and deploy.

3. Add the following entry to the `/etc/hosts` file of your machine to configure the hostname.
   ```
   127.0.0.1 localhost.com
   ```

### Create an Application in Asgardeo
Here we are using Asgardeo as the SAML Identity Provider.
1. Navigate to [**Asgardeo Console**](https://console.asgardeo.io/login) and click on **Applications** under **Develop** tab.

2. Click on **New Application** and then **Traditional Web Application**.

3. Select SAML from the selection and enter any name as the name of the app and add the Assertion Consumer Service URL and Issuer.

4. Click on Register. You will be navigated to management page of the created application.

### Running the sample
Try out the application by accessing the URL http://localhost.com:8080/sample-app/index.html in your web browser. 

## How it works

This section explains detailed walkthrough on how key aspects handled in the Asgardeo Tomcat SAML Agent.

  * [Classify secure resources, unsecured resources](#classify-secure-resources-unsecured-resources)
  * [Trigger authentication](#trigger-authentication)
  * [Retrieve user attributes](#retrieve-user-attributes)
  * [Trigger logout](#trigger-logout)

### Classify secure resources, unsecured resources
In the sample-app, we have two pages. A landing page (`index.html`) which we have not secured, and another 
page (`home.jsp`) which we have secured.

`IndexPage` property of the sample-app.properties file in the `<APP_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes` directory is used to define 
the landing page of the webapp which is also considered as an unsecured page.
Also the same page is used as the page that the user get redirected once the logout is done.
Here we have set `<APP_HOME>/index.html` as the value of `IndexPage` property.
    IndexPage=/sample-app/index.html

By default, all the other pages are considered as secured pages. Hence `home.jsp` will be secured without any other configurations.

### Trigger authentication
In the `<APP_HOME>/index.html` page, we have added the action for the login button to trigger a SAML authentication:
```
<form action="samlsso?SAML2.HTTPBinding=HTTP-POST" method="post">
    <div class="element-padding">
        <input style="height: 30px; width: 60px" type="submit" value="log in">
    </div>
</form>
```

The button click would trigger an authentication request, and redirect the user to the IdP authentication page.
Upon successful authentication, the user would be redirected to the `<APP_HOME>/home.jsp` page.

### Retrieve user attributes

In the `<APP_HOME>/home.jsp` file, we have added the following to get the user subject value and the user attributes 
referring the SDK API.

```
<%
    // Retrieve the session bean.
    LoggedInSessionBean sessionBean = (LoggedInSessionBean) session.getAttribute(SSOAgentConstants.SESSION_BEAN_NAME);

    // SAML response
    SAML2SSO samlResponse = sessionBean.getSAML2SSO();

    // Autheticated username
    String subjectId = samlResponse.getSubjectId();

    // Authenticated user's attributes
    Map<String, String> saml2SSOAttributes = samlResponse.getSubjectAttributes();
%>
```

### Trigger logout
In the `<APP_HOME>/home.jsp` file, we have added the following to trigger a SLO flow:

``<a href="logout?SAML2.HTTPBinding=HTTP-POST">Logout</a>``

Clicking on the logout link would trigger the SLO flow engaging the same filter mentioned above. The user would be
 redirected to the page configured via the `IndexPage` property previously discussed.

## Integrating Asgardeo Tomcat SAML Agent

Asgardeo Tomcat SAML Agent can be integrated in to your applications in two different ways. 

It can be integrated to your java source project of the webapp when the web application is in development stage.

And, the Tomcat SAML agent can be integrated into a pre-built webapp as well.

#### To your existing webapp

To integrate the Tomcat SAML Agent into your pre-built webapps, follow the guide [here](docs/integrating_with_existing_webapp.md/#Integrating_SAML_into_your_existing_Webapp).

#### To your Java source project

To integrate the Tomcat SAML Agent into your java source project, follow the guide [here](docs/integrating_with_java_source_project.md/#Integrating_SAML_into_your_java_source_project).
